# GrblCNC
A C# Clone to LinuxCNC that works with GRBL CNC driver  
#### This project is done in parallel with a compatible Grbl driver firmware

### GRBL for Chinese CNC3040-like machines. WIP. 
### Based on STM32F103C8T6 "Bluepill" boards with customized grblHAL firmware 
#### Project goals: 
* Develop simple open hardware plug to replace the vanishing parallel port
    - Support configurable pin assignments
    - Support extra controls not available on CNC3040 such as mist, flood, spindle RPM reader
* Add support for more axis. (at least add A axis)
* Support other features that LinuxCNC have
